How many times have you come across CTFs where there so many users on system, the most I came across was around 30 users.
Now to check out each directory takes alot of time so this script will just go through each directory and list the contents on the bash_history of each user.

To use:
transfer over to your CTF box (using curl, wget)
chmod +x home_invader.sh
./ home_invader.sh
